Now, they even maintain Altdorf's own engineering treasures - the remaining steam tanks - which is quite a coup!

Even though the primary place of Taal’s worship continues to be the Sacred Forest, worshippers who live within the confines of the city value an opportunity to seek spiritual enlightenment without making a trip to the other end of the crater. Taal’s temple can easily accommodate a thousand adherents in a single, massive service, yet this happens only rarely. More often, services are staggered throughout the day, allowing folks who work at odd hours to maintain a connection with their deity and his clergy. Taal’s temple is natural in appearance. Surrounded by ancient rowan trees, the temple and all within it is formed entirely of gnarled wood." 
 building_taalplace_home_04:0 "The Sacred Forest"
 building_taalplace_home_04_desc:1 "The Greatest Temple dedicated to Taal and Rhya is not a building, but the Sacred Forest located inside the creater "Eye of the Forest". Some Taalite worshippers claim that the Sacred Forest is the only remnants of the once ancient forest that covered the entirety of the Empire in the days of Sigmar, but this claim is often rebuked. Forest itself is a wild place, where every tree is seen as a sacred objective, sometimes the forest grows beyond its reach, and will have to be cut down for the sake of the farmlands that are essential for feeding Talabheim. These trees are often used in the construction of temples dedicated to the God of the Wild, or holy weapons often used by the holy order the Longshanks."
